//! On removal, put every sheep back where it ran before this dog took over.
//!
//! shep runs [`all`] as this dog's own `on-remove` hook, once, before
//! forgetting it. There is no next tick and no retry beyond what is written
//! here, so a failure has to be loud rather than swallowed.
//!
//! # The failure this prevents
//!
//! An operator rehomes the dog, goes back to `~/ReactMap` because that is
//! where they think their app lives, restarts the sheep, and cannot work
//! out why nothing updates. That sheep's `cwd` was never `~/ReactMap`; it
//! was a path under `$SHEP_HOME` they have no reason to know about.
//! [`State::origin_cwd`] and [`State::origin_script`], captured once at
//! opt-in, are where this module puts it back.
//!
//! # Two cases, both answered from `deploy.toml`
//!
//! A sheep that pre-existed the dog has `origin_cwd` and `origin_script`
//! and is restored to them. A sheep the dog bootstrapped has neither, so
//! there is nothing to restore: it is left running from `current`,
//! unchanged, and the report says so plainly. Deleting an app because a
//! deploy tool was uninstalled would be far worse than leaving it.
//!
//! # Why there is a fallback, and why one outcome is worse than the others
//!
//! [`Request::Delete`] is stop plus deregister, and `FlockRegistry::roll`
//! drops a name with no live instance, so delete-then-start is destructive
//! if the start is refused: the sheep would be gone from the flock AND the
//! roll, not returning on a reboot. A refused restore is retried with the
//! config the shepherd had a moment ago, which covers the common causes -
//! a transient refusal, a bad `origin_script`, a `user` that no longer
//! resolves - at the cost of one extra request. Only when that fallback
//! also fails is the sheep genuinely gone, and [`Restored::Lost`] says so
//! in words an operator cannot misread as "still running".
