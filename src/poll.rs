//! The poll loop: what `watch = "auto"` means.
//!
//! Everything else in this crate runs when an operator types a command.
//! This runs unattended, forever, so two properties matter more here than
//! anywhere else: one target's failure must not stop the others, and
//! whatever a tick prints must be true of what it actually did.
//!
//! # What a tick asks the shepherd for
//!
//! One `set_smit` per target and one read of this dog's own section, every
//! tick, and nothing more until it has something to deploy. Targets are read
//! from the filesystem - one directory per target under
//! `<shep_home>/deploy`, each holding its own record - and a target whose
//! branch has not moved is answered by `git` alone. The smit is republished
//! each tick because the daemon holds it in memory only for as long as this
//! dog's connection lasts; see [`tick`]. Past that, the shepherd is asked
//! only by a deploy that is going ahead.
//!
//! The section is re-read rather than read once at startup, because
//! otherwise an operator who changes `interval` or `retention` is told by
//! `shep lookout` that the dog has been told, and the dog goes on polling
//! on the section it read when it started until somebody restarts it. It is
//! a read rather than a subscription to the `config.dog.<name>` the
//! shepherd already publishes: a subscriber that lags drops events, and
//! `ReconnectingClient::subscribe` hands out a stream belonging to one
//! generation of the connection, which this dog outlives on purpose (see
//! `crate::main::poll_forever`). Both mean a bus alone would silently miss
//! a change, which is the failure this exists to remove, so the poll would
//! have had to stay underneath it anyway.
//!
//! In particular the roll is never read. [`crate::roll::registered`] is how
//! `survey` learns what shep has registered, and it goes through
//! `SaveRoll`, which makes the shepherd re-query every live process AND
//! rewrite `flock.json` whether anything changed or not. Once per `survey`
//! is a fair price; once every thirty seconds forever is a disk write per
//! tick for a fact no tick needs.
//!
//! # Serial, and no mid-deploy abort
//!
//! One tick deploys its targets one at a time, and a tick never begins
//! while the previous one is still running, because this is a plain
//! `loop { tick().await; sleep(interval).await; }`. A push landing during a
//! build is therefore picked up on the NEXT tick rather than aborting the
//! one in flight. The design asks for the abort; the cost of deferring it
//! is one build of latency before a hotfix lands, not a wrong outcome.
//!
//! The upside is that [`crate::deploy`]'s own race guard stays a guard.
//! It refuses when `current` moved while a deploy was preparing, and that
//! refusal is there for a second OPERATOR invocation - it never has to hold
//! the loop off itself.
