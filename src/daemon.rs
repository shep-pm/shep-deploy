//! The abstraction every later task uses to talk to the shepherd.
//!
//! One trait, [`Daemon`], names every request this dog makes across the
//! whole engine: reading its own config section, listing and describing the
//! flock, and starting, reloading or restarting a sheep. Everything from
//! Task 3 onward is written against this trait, never against
//! [`Client`] directly, so the whole deploy engine is unit-testable with no
//! shepherd running - a task can hand it a fake and assert on what the fake
//! recorded.
//!
//! There is one real implementation, [`Live`], a thin wrapper over a
//! connected client that turns each method into one [`Request`] and matches
//! the [`Response`] it expects back. Which client it wraps is the one thing
//! the two constructors disagree about, and [`Link`] says why. Test doubles
//! live in each module's own `#[cfg(test)]` block, this one included.
//!
//! # Why a trait at all
//!
//! The `async fn` here is used through a generic bound only, never behind
//! `dyn`. That is a decision rather than an accident: an `async fn` in a
//! trait cannot spell an auto-trait bound on the future it returns, so a
//! caller needing `Send` could not ask for one. This binary runs a single
//! current-thread runtime and has no such caller. The `async_fn_in_trait`
//! lint stays quiet here because a binary's trait is not a public surface;
//! lift this into a library and it starts firing, at which point the
//! trade-off wants deciding rather than silencing.
//!
//! Do not add trait methods speculatively. These nine are the surface plan
//! one and plan two need between them, not nine that looked useful:
//! `list_flock`, `describe` and `reload` are exercised inside plan one
//! (`adopted_name` below, probe-based verification, and the deploy
//! sequence). `dog_config` reads the `[dog.<name>]` section that names the
//! poll loop's interval and retention, via `crate::config::read` and
//! `adopted_name` below. `start` and `delete` are the cutover's, in
//! `crate::optin`: it registers the sheep against `current` and then
//! removes the instances that `Start` was added beside. `restart` is the
//! one with no caller at all; Task 10 chose `Reload` for the whole deploy
//! sequence, and it stays because plan one's own brief named it up front.
//!
//! # Self-identification
//!
//! [`adopted_name`] answers "what did shep register this process as", by
//! finding this process's own pid in the flock listing: it reports a pid per
//! entry and a dog marker per dog, and this process knows its own pid.
//! Getting it wrong means every config lookup silently reads an empty
//! section, which looks exactly like a dog correctly running on defaults -
//! there is no error to notice.
//!
//! shep also puts that name in `$SHEP_DOG_NAME` when it spawns an adopted
//! dog, and [`crate::main`] reads it for the handshake. This lookup stays
//! all the same, because the two answer different questions. The handshake
//! may carry ONLY a name the daemon itself set, never one this process
//! worked out, since a wrong name there has the daemon restart the wrong dog
//! when a refusal arrives. The config section has no such blast radius, and
//! looking it up here keeps working under a shep old enough not to set the
//! variable at all.
