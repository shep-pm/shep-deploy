//! `shep-deploy`: a deploy dog for shep.
//!
//! Watches a git branch, builds a release, swaps to it, and rolls back if it
//! does not come up. This file is the binary entry; the deploy sequence
//! itself lives in [`deploy`], and the layout it works over in [`paths`].
//!
//! # Two invocation modes
//!
//! Supervised, the dog is spawned with no argv at all and two environment
//! entries: `SHEP_HOME`, which every path below is joined onto, and
//! `SHEP_DOG_NAME`, which is what shep registered this process as. That mode
//! runs [`poll::run`], which deploys every `watch = "auto"` target whose
//! branch has moved, once an interval, until the process is asked to stop.
//!
//! The two modes connect differently, in two ways. The poll loop connects
//! through a client that survives a daemon handover, because it is the only
//! mode that outlives one; a verb connects through a plain client and exits.
//! And the poll loop announces a dog name, but only the one shep put in
//! `SHEP_DOG_NAME` - no variable, no dog, no name. See [`poll_forever`] and
//! [`adopted_as`].
//!
//! Run directly, it takes a verb:
//!
//! ```text
//! shep-deploy deploy <sheep>
//! shep-deploy deploy <sheep> --watch auto|manual
//! shep-deploy setup <sheep>
//! shep-deploy survey
//! ```
//!
//! `--watch` changes one setting and returns without deploying. See
//! [`deploy::set_watch`]. `survey` reports where every registered sheep
//! stands and touches nothing; see [`survey::survey`]. `setup` takes a
//! sheep over: it builds the deploy tree and its first release, then
//! re-registers the sheep against `current` and removes the instances it
//! replaced. See [`optin::prepare`] and [`optin::cut_over`] - and note that
//! it is the one deploy that may have downtime, and the one that is not
//! verified against the app's readiness probe.
