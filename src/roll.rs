//! Reading shep's muster roll, which is the only place a dog can see the
//! `AppConfig` a sheep was REGISTERED with.
//!
//! shep states the reason itself, in its own `snapshot.rs`: "nothing in a
//! `ProcessInfo` can reproduce the `AppConfig` a sheep came from, which is
//! exactly what a roll needs". [`ProcessInfo`] carries status, pid, uptime
//! and log paths, and carries neither `cwd` nor `script`. The survey needs
//! the first to tell a git checkout from anything else, and opt-in needs
//! both to record what a removal should restore.
//!
//! # The coupling, named rather than glossed
//!
//! The roll's envelope is `shep-daemon`'s type and this crate does not
//! depend on `shep-daemon`, so the two fields needed here are mirrored and
//! everything else is ignored. That direction is safe: a field added to
//! the envelope later cannot break this. The inner [`AppConfig`] is
//! `shep-core`'s and is shared properly.
//!
//! # What a newer shepherd's roll does here, which changed in shep-core 0.7
//!
//! `AppConfig` was `deny_unknown_fields` until then, so a roll carrying an
//! app field this crate's `shep-core` had never heard of was REFUSED rather
//! than read, loudly and with a remedy. shep-core dropped the attribute on
//! purpose - its own comment says not to restore it - so that roll is now
//! read, and the unknown fields are dropped in silence.
//!
//! For [`crate::survey`] that is the better failure of the two: it reports
//! what it read and a field it never had is a field it never printed. For
//! [`crate::optin`] it is the worse one. That path persists this
//! `AppConfig` into `deploy.toml` as `origin` and hands it back to shep
//! when the dog is removed, so a field dropped on the way in is a field the
//! sheep does not get back on the way out - a sheep restored quietly
//! different from the one that was adopted.
//!
//! Nothing here closes that, and the exposure is a skew rather than a
//! standing hole: the roll is only ever read from a shepherd, and the
//! `shep-core` in `Cargo.toml` is meant to track the shep that wrote it.
//! Closing it would mean this crate keeping its own copy of the field list
//! `shep-core` just stopped enforcing.
//!
//! [`read`] still names the file and the likeliest cause rather than
//! passing a bare serde complaint outward, because the failures that remain
//! are no more actionable on their own than the one that went away.
//!
